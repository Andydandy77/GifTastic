# GifTastic

On this webpage, the user can display gifs by hitting Giphy's API of disney characters by clicking on the buttons at the top. Once the gifs appear, the page also displays the gif's rating below it and a download button (if clicked the page will download the selected gif). 

On the right the user can input a new disney character and the page dynamically adds a new button to the page of the disney character. Once added, the user can click the new button and generate new disney character gifs.

Additionally, when the gifs are generated the page calls on OMDB's API and displays the associated movie's title, release date and IMDB's rating.
